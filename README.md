# copyWaste
open source tool created in AHK , helps copying codes and viewing them instead of  Just pasting them,
which gives programmers more time to understand what they copy.

- Because sometimes skipping/copying steps leaping over the understanding proccess
by just copy-pasting waste so much of your learning path

- personally this tool helped me avoid taking shortcuts,
while still focusing on writing specified part to type

- Recommended tool for anyone wants to launch himself forward,
and Never miss the self code proccessing step at any project for a fully understanding mindset
